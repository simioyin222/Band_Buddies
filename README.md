## Description

The purpose of this project is to make it easier to find local music events to attend for music enthusiasts. We accomplish this by helping to locate nearby music events and concerts. The user is able to enter a music genre of their choice and enter a city to filter search results. The default city is set to Portland, so even if the user doesn't enter a city, they will still be shown results for their preferred genre if there are any matching events. Additionally, a user is able to choose to be able to see shows that are happening later in the year, up to 6 months in advance.
